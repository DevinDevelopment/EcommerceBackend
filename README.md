## Description

In this project we will be assisting with crating a backend application for a ecommerce site.

We will be using the sequalize ORM to populate and make changes to our database using routes and CRUD operations.
We also use Mysql12 to get access to the functions that allow use to perform quieries in our node file.

In this project we learned more about the sequalize ORM and how we can use it to make database changes.
